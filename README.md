# Amazon_Clone_project
ðŸ“¦ Amazon Clone (HTML & CSS Only)
This project is a fully static front-end clone of the Amazon India homepage, built entirely using HTML and CSS. I created it as a hands-on learning project right after completing my first-year university exams, with the aim of reinforcing my understanding of web development fundamentals.

The clone replicates the visual layout and user interface of Amazon's landing page, including key components such as the top navigation bar, responsive product cards, category sections, hero banner, and footer. I focused on writing clean, semantic HTML and modular CSS to simulate the structure and styling of a real-world e-commerce platform without using any external frameworks or JavaScript.

Working on this project helped me:

* Deepen my understanding of Flexbox and positioning techniques

* Explore responsive web design using media queries

* Practice pixel-perfect replication from a live website
  
*Improve my ability to break down complex UIs into reusable sections

Although this is a static clone and doesnâ€™t include dynamic features like search, cart functionality, or user authentication, it serves as a strong foundation for future additions and integration with JavaScript or backend technologies.

I see this as the first step in a larger journey â€” and I'm excited to continue learning, building, and sharing more projects along the way!
